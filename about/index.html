    <h3>What is this</h3>
<p>We live in an amazing time. The amount of resources available for little or no cost on the internet today is staggering. Online books, forum discussions, blogs, videos, and open online classes for almost any subject imaginable are open to public consumption. However, sifting through this information and distilling it into a focused plan can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Top universities and colleges, for the most part, do a great job educating their students.  However there are significant barriers to entry to actually attending and earning a degree these top schools, such as admissions requirements, cost, geographic location, and time investment.  </p>
<p>This site (and GitHub Repo), is an attempt to extract curriculum information from top universities, such as Harvard, MIT, Duke, and Stanford and map it to publicly available learning resources.</p>
